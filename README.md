# Showr

Showr lets singers anonymously share their shower singing with the world. If it is well recieved, they can 'come out of the showr' and reveal their identity.

Showr was created at Startup Weekend Seattle in September 2012. It won 1st place and People's Choice.

This repository contains the carnage from 2 days of intense development of Showr's web frontend. The code herein is quite bad; it is the code of a Rails developer of a week. Hacks. Hacks everywhere.
